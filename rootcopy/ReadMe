Folders/files that you add here will be copied to the chroot, just before creating 01-filesystem.squashfs.
Before running ./build-trixie , create a folder structure e.g. usr/bin/ , usr/local/bin , usr/share/ or root/ with file(s) inside.

Note: existing files in chroot will be overwritten by these !
So this can also be used to replace files in the system.
